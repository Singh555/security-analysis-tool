# gosec-tool

This is a command-line tool written in Go for security analysis of Go code using the gosec package.

## Explanation

The tool checks if the gosec package is installed and attempts to install it if it's not found. It then analyzes the specified directory for security vulnerabilities using gosec.

## Usage

Ensure you have Go installed on your system before running this tool.

1. Clone or download the repository containing this code.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `gosec-tool` source code.
3. Run the following command to build the tool:
    ```
    go build gosec-tool.go
    ```

After building the tool, you can use it to analyze Go code. The tool takes a directory path as input and performs security analysis on all Go files in that directory.

./gosec-tool <directory-path>

Replace `<directory-path>` with the path to the directory you want to analyze.
